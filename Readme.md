## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Distribution

**Nexlify AppImage (Linux - Beta)**

For Linux users seeking a convenient, portable, and self-contained application, Nexlify is also available as an **AppImage** in beta testing.

- **Download:** You can find the Nexlify AppImage in the **"Releases"** section of our GitHub repository. Look for files named like `Nexlify-x86_64.AppImage` or similar.
- **Make Executable:** After downloading, you'll likely need to make the AppImage executable. You can do this in your terminal using:
  ```bash
  chmod +x Nexlify-x86_64.AppImage
  ```
  (Replace `Nexlify-x86_64.AppImage` with the actual filename you downloaded.)
- **Run:** Simply double-click the AppImage file to run Nexlify, or execute it from the terminal:
  ```bash
  ./Nexlify-x86_64.AppImage
  ```

**Important Note for AppImage Users:**

When using the Nexlify AppImage, it's crucial to understand how API keys are loaded. The AppImage is a single, packaged file. To ensure Nexlify can access your API keys, you **must place the `.env` file in the same directory where you have stored the Nexlify AppImage file.**

For example, if you download `Nexlify-x86_64.AppImage` and place it in your `Downloads` folder, your `.env` file (containing `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, etc.) must also be located in the `Downloads` folder alongside the AppImage. **Failing to place the `.env` file in the correct location will prevent Nexlify from accessing your API keys, and it will not function correctly.**

### Google API Integration

1.  **Obtain Google API credentials** from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). You'll need to create a project and enable the Generative Language API.
2.  **Add your API key to the `.env` file:**

    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```

### Groq Implementation

1.  **Sign up for Groq access** at [groq.com](https://groq.com).
2.  **Add your Groq API key to the `.env` file:**

    ```env
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
    ```

### OpenRouter Configuration

1.  **Create an account at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)**.
2.  **Generate an API key** from your OpenRouter account.
3.  **Add your OpenRouter API key to the `.env` file:**

    ```env
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
    ```

**Running Nexlify (from Source or Extracted ZIP):**

1.  **Ensure you have Python installed** (version 3.7 or higher is recommended).
2.  **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run Nexlify:**
    ```bash
    python Nexlify.py
    ```
    Nexlify will start in your system tray. Click the system tray icon to open the application.

### Command Reference

Nexlify supports several slash commands that can be used in the chat interface:
